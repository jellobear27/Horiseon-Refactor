# <Horiseon-Refactor>

## Description

- My motivation was to refactor the current code to be accessible.
- I built this project using a starter code and modified it to be accessible. This ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards.
- Creating accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities can't access their website.
- I learned the difference non-semantic and semantic html elements.
